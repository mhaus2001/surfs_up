## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gather data in order to support our descion to start a buisness in Hawaii, this data would be then be used in order to convince investors of the validity and benefit of our buisness proposal. 
## Results
- According to the data there is only a variation of 3 degrees in between the mean temperature of the two months
- standard deviation for both months is around 3 degrees with only slightly greater deviation in december by .5 degrees 
- there is a difference in minimum temperatures for those months but considering the prevoisu data in mean and standard deviation it is not likley to signifigant impact ability to do buisness

## Summary of Data 
- The overall conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that temperatures wont have a major effect in buisness year round as there is not enough signifigant evidence or variaton to suggest temperature serving as a limiting factor 
- For additional queries involving weather the first I would do would be to look into extreme wether patterns by looking writing queries that look into when occurences of percipitation excedded certain amounts
- As well to follow up on that an addition querie could be written that looks into data around wind speed as both listed factors could have an effect on the willingness of investors to invest into our buisness
